### "Claude Code as an MCP Server" Integration & Dynamic Module System
**NOTE:** Claude Code as an MCP Server simply exposes Claude Codeâ€™s tools to your MCP client, so your own client is responsible for implementing user confirmation for individual tool calls. See @schema.ts for latest specification and @mcp-hosts.md for best practices when designing a host. The server provides access to Claudeâ€™s tools like View, Edit, LS, etc. Add Claude Code MCP server via:
    """
    {
        "command": "claude",
        "args": ["mcp", "serve"],

## Notes

### Prioritization Criteria
1. **User Impact**: How many users will benefit?
2. **Technical Complexity**: How difficult is implementation?
3. **Dependencies**: What needs to be built first?
4. **Resource Requirements**: Time, compute, storage needs
5. **Strategic Value**: Does it differentiate the product?

### Next Sprint Recommendations
1. ~~Fix the PostgreSQL search query bug (Critical)~~ âœ…
2. ~~Implement the evaluation system (High)~~ âœ… *Full UI integration completed*
3. Add batch import functionality (High)
4. Improve performance with caching (High)

### Long-term Vision
The journal app should evolve into a comprehensive personal knowledge management system that:
- Learns from user patterns
- Provides actionable insights
- Integrates seamlessly with daily workflows
- Maintains absolute privacy
- Scales to lifetime usage
