- **User Experience**: Reduces uncertainty and improves trust in the system

### Key Components
1. **Visual Progress Tracker**: Animated stage indicators showing current processing status
2. **Processing Logs**: Detailed, timestamped logs for each processing stage
3. **AI Failure Analysis**: Intelligent diagnosis of failures with probable causes and solutions
4. **Real-time Updates**: SSE-based push notifications for stage transitions

## Processing Stages Explained

### 1. Created
- **Description**: Entry saved to database

- **Icon**: Package
- **What Happens**: Initial record created with placeholder data

### 2. Analyzing
- **Description**: AI analyzing content
- **Duration**: 2-5 seconds
- **Icon**: CPU
- **What Happens**: 
  - Qwen 2.5 processes journal content
  - Extracts entities, topics, sentiment
  - Identifies URLs to fetch

### 3. Fetching URLs
- **Description**: Retrieving linked content
- **Duration**: 5-30 seconds (varies by URL count)
- **Icon**: Link
- **What Happens**:
  - MCP agent fetches content from mentioned URLs
  - Extracts titles and relevant information
  - Stores fetched data for embedding

### 4. Generating Embeddings
- **Description**: Creating semantic search data
- **Duration**: 1-3 seconds
- **Icon**: Database
- **What Happens**:
  - Combines entry content with processed data
  - Generates 768-dimensional vector using nomic-embed-text
  - Enables semantic search capabilities

### 5. Completed
- **Description**: Processing finished
- **Icon**: CheckCircle
- **What Happens**: All data saved, entry fully searchable

### 6. Failed (Error State)
- **Description**: Processing encountered an error
- **Icon**: AlertCircle

## Common Failure Scenarios

### 1. Ollama Service Issues (70% of failures)
- **Cause**: Ollama not running or model not installed
- **Solution**: Run `ollama serve` and `ollama pull qwen2.5:7b`
- **Detection**: Connection refused errors in analyzing stage

### 2. MCP Agent Unavailable (60% of URL failures)
